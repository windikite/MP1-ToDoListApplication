My first mini-project with coding temple! This was a lot of fun to do and I even ended up digging for some functionality I didn't really consider before. My favorite part was going and color-coding the terminal, despite being a relatively small thing. It did boost the readability a lot though. 

Features:

    -create, view, update and delete entries on a to-do list
    
    -set prioritiy levels on tasks and mark them as complete when done
    
    -after each operation whether successful or failed, it will prompt you again for another
    
    -distinct terminal colors to help you see important information
    
Instructions:

    1. Download!
    
    2. Follow the prompts in the terminal! 
    
        2a. This application primarily uses numbers to select from the menus, so if there is an option with a 1 at the start that you want to choose, press 1 and enter when prompted.
        
    3. Enjoy!
